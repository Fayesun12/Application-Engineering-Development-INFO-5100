## Aasha Food Management Ecosystem

### Problem Definition and Background

With the increasing number of deaths due to scarcity of food each year, it is necessary for such
audience facing food crisis to have proper food requests addressed to the food distributors and
suppliers which would also help them to treat all the extra food to the right set of audience with
the proper quality evaluation of food. On an average, there are 9.1 billion deaths per minute over
the world and 40.6 million people deaths in the United States due to food crisis. In addition to this,
it is essential for them to define a set of parameters for evaluating appropriate food request and
distributing service and quality evaluating service accordingly. This parameter should be
constructed on one’s concern like ‘how can the request reach from shelter house to distributor?’,
‘How can the enterprise flow can be managed?’ ‘How can the list be available to the distributor
with NGO approval?’, ‘How will the Distributor take request from multiple requests and send it
to Quality Enterprise?’. In addition to these concerns, the quality enterprise itself should be able
to see the list of the items provided by distributor and accordingly approve or provide feedback to
incoming request and sent confirmation back to NGO & Distributor. 

### Proposed Solution
● We target to construct a Food management solution system using software engineering
techniques for enhancing the proper utilization for food distributive services provided by
the different food enterprise and accordingly design system for solving major food crises
problems faced by the shelter enterprises.
● The Food Management solution will enable the shelter to generate multiple requests to
NGO , then the NGO only on approval could send it to other enterprise like Distributor,
followed by Distributor sending it to Quality for the provided stock of items, in such a way
without compromising the quality of the food, they are delivered to the shelter enterprise
and also to avoid any human loss due to scarcity in food services.
● The considered paradigm system is built on parameters like a request generation, the
approval of requests from different enterprise and forwarding it to other enterprise.
● Our end goal is to design a food management solution system that will generate food
requests from different shelters from different cities and accordingly with authorization
levels and quality check services, approve the main request and thus make the quality check
food delivered to different shelters accordingly.
