# Aasha Food Management Ecosystem
Problem Definition and Background
With the increasing number of deaths due to scarcity of food each year, it is necessary for such audience facing food crisis to have proper food requests addressed to the food distributors and suppliers which would also help them to treat all the extra food to the right set of audience with the proper quality evaluation of food. On an average, there are 9.1 billion deaths per minute over the world and 40.6 million people deaths in the United States due to food crisis. In addition to this, it is essential for them to define a set of parameters for evaluating appropriate food request and distributing service and quality evaluating service accordingly. This parameter should be constructed on one’s concern like ‘how can the request reach from shelter house to distributor?’, ‘How can the enterprise flow can be managed?’ ‘How can the list be available to the distributor with NGO approval?’, ‘How will the Distributor take request from multiple requests and send it to Quality Enterprise?’. In addition to these concerns, the quality enterprise itself should be able to see the list of the items provided by distributor and accordingly approve or provide feedback to incoming request and sent confirmation back to NGO & Distributor.

### Proposed Solution
● We target to construct a Food management solution system using software engineering techniques for enhancing the proper utilization for food distributive services provided by the different food enterprise and accordingly design system for solving major food crises problems faced by the shelter enterprises. ● The Food Management solution will enable the shelter to generate multiple requests to NGO , then the NGO only on approval could send it to other enterprise like Distributor, followed by Distributor sending it to Quality for the provided stock of items, in such a way without compromising the quality of the food, they are delivered to the shelter enterprise and also to avoid any human loss due to scarcity in food services. ● The considered paradigm system is built on parameters like a request generation, the approval of requests from different enterprise and forwarding it to other enterprise. ● Our end goal is to design a food management solution system that will generate food requests from different shelters from different cities and accordingly with authorization levels and quality check services, approve the main request and thus make the quality check food delivered to different shelters accordingly.
